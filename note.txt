### Core User Flow
**Chat Command ‚Üí AI Processing ‚Üí Timeline Updates ‚Üí Real-Time Preview ‚Üí Export**

Example Workflow:
1. User: "Trim the first 10 seconds and add a fade-in effect"
2. AI processes natural language and identifies: trim operation + fade effect
3. Timeline automatically updates with new cuts and transitions
4. Preview player shows real-time changes
5. User can continue with more commands or export the final video

**Advanced Example:**
"Make the intro 5 seconds, add animated captions saying 'Welcome to our channel', and include lofi background music at 30% volume"
‚Üí AI parses multiple operations ‚Üí Executes trim, caption, and audio operations ‚Üí Updates timeline ‚Üí Shows live preview
